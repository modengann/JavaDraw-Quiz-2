/** 
 *  Write code to:
 *  1. Create a circle with a radius of 100. The circle can be 
 *  located anywhere on the screen to start. 
 *  
 *  When the mouse is clicked: 
 *  1. The color of the circle should change randomly.
 *  2. The center of the circle should move so that it's X coordinate of the circle is the Y 
 *     coordinate of the mouse press. Similarly, the Y coordinate of the circle should be
 *     from the X coordinate of the mouse press. 
 *     
 *     Ex. If I click at (200, 300), the circle should move to (300,200). It should also change
 *     its color randomly.
 *     
 *     If I click at (150, 600), the circle should move to (600, 150). It should also change its
 *     color randomly.
 * 
 * To earn an A+:
 * 
 * Complete all the above requirements and surprise me! Be creative in 
 * showing me that you have a mastery of the JavaDraw concepts. This can 
 * be anything that you'd like that you think is impressive!
